# ZK Voting Protocol: Anti-Flash Loan Mechanism

## Overview

This document describes the anti-flash loan protection mechanism implemented in the ZK-VOTE protocol. Flash loan attacks allow an attacker to borrow large amounts of tokens, use them to gain voting power, vote, and return the tokens — all within a single transaction. The ZK-VOTE protocol prevents this through a combination of balance snapshotting, time-weighted average balances, and transfer cooldowns.

## Attack Vector

If election eligibility is gated on token balance (e.g., requiring governance token holdings to vote), without protection:

1. Attacker flash-loans a large amount of governance tokens from a lending protocol
2. Attacker registers for an election (which checks current balance)  
3. Attacker casts a vote with inflated voting power
4. Attacker returns the borrowed tokens
5. All within a single Stellar transaction (multi-operation)

## Protection Mechanisms

### 1. Balance Snapshotting

**Location**: `contracts/voting/src/lib.rs` — `DataKey::BalanceSnapshot`, `create_balance_snapshot()`

When a proposal (election) is created, the current ledger sequence is recorded as the snapshot point in `ProposalInfo.snapshot_ledger`. Token balances are frozen at this point for eligibility determination.

**Key components**:
- `BalanceSnapshotInfo` struct stores `snapshot_ledger` (ledger sequence) and `timestamp`
- `ProposalInfo.snapshot_ledger` field records when the proposal was created
- `create_balance_snapshot()` captures the snapshot
- `get_balance_snapshot()` retrieves the snapshot for verification

### 2. Voter Eligibility at Snapshot Time

**Location**: `contracts/voting/src/lib.rs` — `check_voter_eligibility()`

Voter eligibility checks the voter's balance at the snapshot ledger, not the current ledger. This prevents flash loans because:

- The snapshot was taken at proposal creation (before the attacker could borrow)
- Current balance is irrelevant for eligibility
- Flash loans cannot change historical balance data

**Flow**:
1. `ElectionConfig` stores `min_balance`, `twab_window`, and `snapshot_ledger`
2. `check_voter_eligibility()` verifies `balance_at_snapshot >= cfg.min_balance`
3. Token contracts call this function before allowing votes in token-gated elections

### 3. Election Configuration

**Location**: `contracts/voting/src/lib.rs` — `ElectionConfig`, `DataKey::ElectionConfig`

Each proposal can have an `ElectionConfig` that defines:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `snapshot_ledger` | `u32` | Ledger sequence at configuration creation |
| `min_balance` | `i128` | Minimum token balance required to vote |
| `twab_window` | `u64` | Time window for TWAB computation (0 = disable TWAB) |

Configured via `set_election_config()` and retrieved via `get_election_config()`.

### 4. Time-Weighted Average Balance (TWAB)

**Location**: `contracts/voting/src/lib.rs` — `record_balance_checkpoint()`, `get_time_weighted_average_balance()`

TWAB provides Sybil resistance by measuring the average balance over time, not just at a single point. This prevents:

- Flash loans (instant balance changes don't affect the average)
- Balance renting (temporary transfers for voting power)

**How it works**:
- `BalanceCheckpoint` stores (dao_id, address, ledger_seq) -> balance
- Token contracts call `record_balance_checkpoint()` when balances change
- `get_time_weighted_average_balance()` computes the average across a ledger range
- TWAB = Σ(balance_i × duration_i) / total_duration

### 5. Transfer Cooldown

**Location**: 
- `contracts/voting/src/lib.rs` — `set_voter_cooldown()`, `clear_voter_cooldown()`, `is_in_transfer_cooldown()`
- `contracts/membership-sbt/src/lib.rs` — `set_election_cooldown()`, `clear_election_cooldown()`, `is_in_cooldown()`

During an active election, registered voters enter a transfer cooldown that prevents them from:

- Transferring governance tokens out (reducing their stake)
- Leaving the DAO (bypassing membership requirements)
- Having their SBT revoked to avoid vote accountability

**Cooldown enforcement**:
- `set_voter_cooldown()` sets a 7-day cooldown when a voter registers/votes
- `is_in_transfer_cooldown()` is called by token contracts before allowing transfers
- `leave()` in SBT contract checks cooldown before allowing departure
- Cooldown is cleared when the election ends via `clear_voter_cooldown()`

## Integration Guide

### For Token Contracts

Token contracts should integrate with the voting contract to enforce flash loan protection:

```rust
// Before allowing a transfer, check cooldown
fn transfer(..., from: Address, ...) {
    let voting_contract: Address = ...;
    let in_cooldown: bool = env.invoke_contract(
        &voting_contract,
        &Symbol::new(&env, "is_in_transfer_cooldown"),
        vec![&env, dao_id.into_val(&env), from.clone().into_val(&env)],
    );
    if in_cooldown {
        panic!("Transfer blocked: voter is in election cooldown");
    }
    // Proceed with transfer
}

// Record balance checkpoints for TWAB
fn after_balance_change(..., voter: Address, new_balance: i128) {
    let voting_contract: Address = ...;
    env.invoke_contract(
        &voting_contract,
        &Symbol::new(&env, "record_balance_checkpoint"),
        vec![&env, dao_id.into_val(&env), voter.into_val(&env), new_balance.into_val(&env)],
    );
}
```

### For Election Creation

```rust
// Create a token-gated election
fn create_token_gated_proposal(...) {
    let proposal_id = voting_contract.create_proposal(...);
    
    // Create balance snapshot
    voting_contract.create_balance_snapshot(dao_id, proposal_id);
    
    // Configure token-gating
    voting_contract.set_election_config(
        dao_id, 
        proposal_id, 
        min_balance: 1000 * 10^7, // 1000 tokens (7 decimal places)
        twab_window: 86400, // 24-hour TWAB window
    );
}
```

### For Voting

```rust
fn vote_with_token_gate(..., voter, proposal_id) {
    // Check eligibility at snapshot time (not current balance)
    let eligible = voting_contract.check_voter_eligibility(
        dao_id, 
        proposal_id, 
        voter,
        current_balance,
        balance_at_snapshot_ledger,
    );
    if !eligible {
        panic!("Insufficient balance at snapshot time");
    }
    
    // Set cooldown to prevent transfer after voting
    voting_contract.set_voter_cooldown(dao_id, voter);
    
    // Submit vote
    voting_contract.vote(...);
}
```

## Storage Keys

### Voting Contract

| DataKey | Type | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `BalanceSnapshot(dao_id, proposal_id)` | `BalanceSnapshotInfo` | Balance snapshot at proposal creation |
| `ElectionConfig(dao_id, proposal_id)` | `ElectionConfig` | Token-gating configuration |
| `TransferCooldown(dao_id, address)` | `u64` | Cooldown end timestamp |
| `BalanceCheckpoint(dao_id, address, ledger)` | `i128` | Balance at a specific ledger |

### Membership SBT Contract

| DataKey | Type | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| `TransferCooldown(dao_id, address)` | `u64` | Cooldown end timestamp for SBT transfers |
| `InActiveElection(dao_id, address)` | `bool` | Whether member is in an active election |

## Error Codes

| Contract | Error | Code | Description |
|----------|-------|------|-------------|
| Voting | `TransferCooldownActive` | 27 | Transfer blocked during active election |
| Voting | `InsufficientSnapshotBalance` | 28 | Balance at snapshot time below minimum |
| SBT | `CooldownActive` | 6 | Cannot leave DAO during active election |

## Security Considerations

1. **Ledger sequence vs timestamp**: Snapshots use ledger sequence numbers which are monotonically increasing and cannot be manipulated. Timestamps are used only for cooldown expiry.

2. **TWAB granularity**: Balance checkpoints should be recorded at every balance change to ensure accurate TWAB computation. Sparse checkpoints reduce accuracy.

3. **Cooldown duration**: The 7-day cooldown is a default that should be adjusted based on the election duration. Short elections may use shorter cooldowns; long elections should extend it.

4. **Gas costs**: TWAB computation iterates over checkpoints within a range. For frequently-traded tokens, this could be expensive. Consider limiting the checkpoint range.
